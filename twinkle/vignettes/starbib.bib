Difficulties in estimation, sensitivity to the way inputs are scaled and choice of optimization algorithm is a common feature in many nonlinear models. A recent study by \cite{Maugeri2013} argues using monte carlo experiments that the popular 'concentrated sum of squares' method for estimating these model may yield biased and inconsistent estimates in small samples.},
